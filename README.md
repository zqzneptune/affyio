# affyio
This repo originates from [bmbolstad/affyio](https://github.com/bmbolstad/affyio) and primarily focuses on parsing Affymetrix data files based upon file format information.

I have made modifcations so that it adaptes to variations in CEL files deposited in [NCBI GEO database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
